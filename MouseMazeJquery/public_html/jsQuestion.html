            1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements? 
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
This code will wait for 2 seconds to call the booyah method. 

setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
This code will call the booyah method immediately because we called the method by booyah().
 

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)? 
var myfunc = function(a, x) { return a * x; }; 
var x = myfunc(2, 3); 
var y = myfunc; 
alert(x); 
alert(y(2,3)); 

This will generate 2 alerts contains content “6”. 
Because x = myfunc(2,3) calles the myfunc and save returns value in x variable;
Then value of y is myfunc that means y = same function.


3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!” 
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); 
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

function booyah1(){ alert("BOOYAH1"); }
function booyah2(){ 
	setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
}

function myFunction() {
  setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); 
  setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
}
